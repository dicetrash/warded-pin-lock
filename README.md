# warded-pin-lock

This is a small freecad file representing a small addition to a pin tumbler to add a warding portion
the concept is that you would use a couple master wafers to make sure that the pin is set to the right hight and as a bunch of false sets.
the pin would be a spool pin or other custom ward carved into it and an edge of it would be exposed to the ward test rail.

I didn't use any standard sizes, so please just adjust sizing as fit (and possibly even MR it back to me if you adjust them in the drawing.
